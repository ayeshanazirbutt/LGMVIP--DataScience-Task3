## Model Performance
The Stacked LSTM model achieved a training accuracy of 98%and a test set accuracy of 89%. This indicates that the model effectively captures patterns and trends in the stock market data.

## Mean Square Error (MSE)
The Mean Square Error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. In this project, the MSE was calculated as 0.244, indicating that the model's predictions are close to the actual values.

## Additional Performance Metrics
In addition to MSE, other performance metrics were evaluated:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.171
- R-squared (R2) Score: 0.743

These metrics provide further insights into the model's accuracy and ability to explain the variance in the target variable.

## Robust Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using multiple performance metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of its predictive ability. This ensures a robust evaluation of the model's accuracy and reliability.

## Data Preprocessing
The project involved preprocessing the data by scaling the features and splitting them into training and test sets. The LSTM model was then trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data to assess its generalization ability.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
The model's architecture and hyperparameters, such as the number of LSTM layers, dropout rate, number of epochs, and batch size, were optimized to achieve the best possible performance. Techniques like grid search can be employed for further hyperparameter tuning.

## Future Work
The project can be extended by incorporating additional features, such as technical indicators or sentiment analysis, to enhance the model's predictive power. Exploring different architectures, such as Bidirectional LSTM or Convolutional LSTM, could also be beneficial.

## Overall
The project successfully applied Stacked LSTM architecture with dropout regularization for stock market prediction and achieved promising results. The performance metrics demonstrated the model's effectiveness in forecasting stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and traders in making informed decisions.
